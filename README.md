## Description

VARY IMPORTANT READ THIS!!

This Arc reactor was design in Fusion 360 under the free license, The Autodesk team has stated that "non-commercial use" meaning no one is allowed to sell or manufature the Arc reactor for profit!

DO NOT SEND ME ANY MESSAGE ABOUT PERSMISSION TO USE MY DESIGN FOR COMMERCIAL USE!

I have no controll over what will happen if failed to follow the terms, I did my end of the agreement by stating the obvious, if the end user fails to follow these terms, you will be hold accountable!

If you like my work and would like to show appreciation then consider leaving a Tip. Thank you! [PaypalMe](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ProgramFreakHD9999)

## Summary

After looking at so many designs by many people on thingiverse, I couldn't find anything worth printing, so I decided to design my own as I imagined. My design is a bit complicated and requires stady hands, accuracy and patience to make, but it was all worth it at the end. This repository includes everything you need to make your own arc reactor and a list of components you need.

## My Print Choice

I decided to print mine in PLA, mainly because it's cheaper and easy to print, and doesn't have a big risk of warpage if you print without a heat chamber. For my arc reactor I decided to use black, transparent & metallic gold PLA. You need transparent PLA or any other transparent filament to be able to make the glow rings, and you need gold filament to print the gold ring in the center of the arc reactor.

Take a look in infill & resolution settings chart underneath to see what parts have to be printed in what filament color.

## Infill & Resolution Settings

The infill & resolution settings I used for my arc reactor varies from parts to parts, most likely 20% infill, but for some parts it had to be 100%. I privided a chart for the print settings and resolution that I used, so that it will make it more easier for you to get you started printing.

**(NOTE: DO NOT MESS WITH THE PARTS ORIENTATION WHEN YOU LOAD THE STL FILES INTO PRUSASLICER!)**

## Assembling Of Arc Reactor

To assemble the arc reactor there isn't an easy way of describing it, for some people it's a walk in the park and for some others it's mind baffling, I will tell you this, you need good level of soldiering skills, precision and accuracy to asseble it beacuse it requires you to solder near plastic parts, and if you're not careful, you will end up with melt marks in the arc reactor.


**(NOTE: SUPERGLUE OR ANY KIND OF BONDING COMPOUND ARE NOT ALLOWED DURING ASSEMBLY OF ARK REACTOR! ONLY SCREWS ARE MEANT TO BE USED DURING ASSEMBLING!)**
