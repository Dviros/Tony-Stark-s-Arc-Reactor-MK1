# LED ring assembly for the glow ring.

## Soldering of the glow ring

The glow ring requires 10 white LED's soldered in a circular ring shape, now for some and many, it might be dificult to solder 10 leds in a circle by freehanding it, well, not wo worry, I have included a jig for you to print and use, it allows you to mount the LED's in a upright possiston for a better and easy solder job, and also allows you to solder them in a circular ring shape. This jig can be found [Here](https://github.com/ProgramFreakHD/Tony-Stark-Arc-Reactor-MK1/tree/main/Arc%20Reactor%20MK1%20LED%20Ring%20Jig).

## Wire wrap and mounting

Insert the Led ring you just finished soldering into the transparent glow ring print, from there, you need the 10pcs wire brackets and some enameled copper wire. Don't forget to solder a pair of enameled copper wire to the led ring to provide power to the ring.

To obtain the enameled copper wire, you can find meters worth of copper wires in some old transformers, or just buy some enameled copper wire from the web.

To keep the copper wire from unwinding itself after a wrap, the best and easiest way I found is to scrape the enameling of the wire and solder the wires together for a secure fixturing.
